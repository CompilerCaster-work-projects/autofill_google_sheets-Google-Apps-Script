# autofill_google_sheets
## Description
In this project, I automated the process of filling out a google sheets file called "Needs". Previously, it was filled in manually by my company's employees (doctors) and my automation allowed:
1. Reduce the time spent by doctors on filling out this file
2. Completely remove the mistakes made by people when filling out this file

The work schedule of medical personnel is required in order for senior paramedics, in agreement with medical professionals, to enter information about periods of work and rest, illness, as well as information about the dismissal of medical personnel. The schedule of medical personnel is a set of sheets (in accordance with the cities), with tables, formulas and symbols located on them.
This file consists of typical blocks, one of which I will describe now. All other blocks look about the same (built according to the same type):
