# autofill_google_sheets
## description
In this project, I automated the process of filling out a google sheets file called "Needs". Previously, it was filled in manually by my company's employees (doctors) and my automation allowed:
1. Reduce the time spent by doctors on filling out this file
2. Completely remove the mistakes made by people when filling out this file
